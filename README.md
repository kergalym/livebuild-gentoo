Gentoo LiveBuild Scripts 
===

These scripts are semi-automated and designed to create and modify custom Gentoo-based LiveSystem (from stage3) that can be burned to DVD or recorded to Flash Drive

Don't hesitate to adjust them for youself

## Usage:

Running buildsysio.sh without any argument shows list of exist arguments, here they are:

start: chrooting into exist system to made changes
stop: umounts exist chroot session
iso: packing live system into squashfs image and then create iso image
buildroot: create live system from scratch (from stage3)


DISCLAIMER: These scripts still under developing. Use at own risk!
